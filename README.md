Introduction:

This program is a web application that allows users to record audio and convert it to text using a web browser. It can be used in applications such as writing voice notes or instant translation. The program relies on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to using PHP to store the converted texts in a database.
Main components:

HTML:

Represents the general structure of the application, including buttons to record, display the text, and a button to save the text in the database.

CSS:

Used to format the user interface and make the application easy to use and attractive. This includes designing buttons, texts, and different sections of the page.

JavaScript:

Includes the code needed to use the browser's Speech Recognition API.

It is used to start and stop recording audio, process the results, and convert the audio to text.

JavaScript is also used to send the converted text to the server (PHP) to save it in the database.

PHP:

Deals with receiving the converted text from JavaScript and storing it in a database.

-Before use, check browser compatibility: Make sure your browser supports the voice recognition API (such as Chrome).


Program use:
Use the application interface to record the audio and convert it to text.

After conversion, the user can save the text in the database using the appropriate button.

Display Results:
The converted text will appear on the user interface in the text box and the user can correct or modify it before saving it in the database.
